Based On:
This project is refered from the  Kaggle notebook by [robikscube] (https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/sentiment-analysis-python-youtube-tutorial).  
explored to better understand sentiment analysis and NLP techniques.

Tools & Libraries Used:

- scikit-learn
- nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Jupyter Notebook

Dataset**:
Used the `train.csv` dataset from the amazon which includes text and sentiment labels.

Steps Involved:
1. Loading and inspecting data
2. Cleaning and preprocessing text
3. Tokenization & removing stopwords
4. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
5. Training a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluating accuracy and performance

 Outcome:
Successfully built a sentiment analysis model that predicts sentiment with good accuracy.
